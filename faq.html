                    Choosing your path after high school is never easy. 
                    <br> Back then, I felt a strong need to explore who 
                    I was and understand myself better. I've always loved languages, different cultures, and writing, 
                    so I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Language and International Politics. 
                    That experience gave me the chance to grow, travel, and explore the world in so many ways.
                    <br> After that, I went on to do a Master's in Communication at the Department of Applied IT 
                    at Gothenburg University, where I first got introduced to the world of IT. 
                    <br> Curious to dive deeper, I took a freestanding course in programming (Python), 
                    specifically designed for people with a humanities background, at Linnaeus University. 
                    <br> That's when everything clicked, and I knew exactly which direction I wanted to take moving forward.

                    I know this is one of those classic questions, but I like to think ahead. 
                    <br> In 10 years, I hope to have a fulfilling career in a workplace that feels 
                    supportive and inspiring, with colleagues who motivate me and share in the journey. 
                    <br> I also dream of crossing Vasaloppet off my bucket list ‚Äî it's a big goal I‚Äôm excited about.

                    enjoying the ride and all the moments along the way!

                    I have two LIA periods during the next school year. 
                    The first one during week 38 - 45 (2025) and the second one during week 02 - 21 (2026). 
                    <br> I can do both experiences at the same company or at two different companies. 
                    <br> My goal with the LIA periods is to put into practices what I learn in school. 
                    <br> I am excited to see how what I learned is applied on a workplace and I cannot wait
                    to deepen my skills and gain new ones.

                    <br> Coding feels like this perfect blend of creativity and logical thinking, 
                    <br> and that balance keeps me both excited and challenged.
